# Image2PDF
Image2PDF a simple WPF application developed in C#. I've used [iTextSharp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/itextsharp) library to create the PDFs. It's a great open-source library with lots of capabilities.

I've also started using [SyncFusion WPF control library](https://www.syncfusion.com/products/wpf) recently. The entire control suite is free of charge (which is always a great price!). It has a Wizard control which I decided to go with. I think using a wizard and is cleaner UI instead of dumping every control on one window.
